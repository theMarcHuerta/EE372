  Project Name: Hierarchical C++ Modeling
============================================================================

  Description:
    Beginner Level Toolkit

    The two labs in this example are designed to illustrate how design
    hierarchy can be modeled in C++. The two main concerns when it comes
    to design hierarchy is the modeling of hierarchical connectivity as
    well as the representation of concurrency in a purely sequential
    design language such as C++.
